Soap Betting is a smart contract for a blockchain-enabled betting platform running on any EVM.

It is a project called Fight Club, which was designed to be used for betting on sports fights. It works with a token called SOAP which can be used for betting and staking, and it also enables users to bet using the native coin of the chain where the dapp is running (In this case, it was BNB). BNB betting can have a certain fee that goes to stakers of the SOAP token. The utility of SOAP would then be tri-fold: 
- Can be used to bet without any fees;
- Can be used to stake for BNB returns;
- Can be used as a speculatory asset.

As a speculatory asset, SOAP would be subject to a 10% fee on all trades to discourage high volatility or bot trading.
